## Features

### Game Mechanics

Each choice has specific combinations it can defeat. For example, rock crushes scissors and lizard, while paper covers rock and disproves spock.

#### Scoring

## Future Implementations

### Enhanced Winner Descriptions
To improve the user experience, consider implementing a dictionary in JavaScript to provide more descriptive winner descriptions. For example, instead of simply stating "Rock beats Scissors," the game could display "Rock crushes Scissors" or "Lizard poisons Spock," adding a layer of thematic immersion to the gameplay.

### Additional Visual Effects
Explore adding more visual effects and animations to enhance the game's aesthetics and engagement. This could include particle effects, transitions, or dynamic backgrounds to create a more immersive experience for players.
